In this repository a basic html-only website will be built. It will a recipe website (hopefully) filled with my favorite recipes. This project is intended to test me on the new html skills I have learned. The website I'll create will contain the following elements and challenges:
- Setting up and linking to a GIT repo
- Setting up a basic boilerplate
- Using headers, paragraphs, links, images and maybe more
- Creating relative web-pages 
- I don't know, maybe even more
